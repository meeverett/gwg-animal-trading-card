			<p>The aye-aye is a type of lemur, native to Madagascar that combines rodent-like teeth that perpetually grow and a special thin middle finger to find food via <em>percussive foraging</em>. It taps on trees to find grubs, then gnaws holes in the wood using its forward slanting incisors to create a small hole in which it inserts its narrow middle finger to pull the grubs out. It is the world's largest nocturnal primate and most commonly lives in canopy areas of the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
